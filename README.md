I have successfully developed and deployed a dynamic and user-friendly clothing store website using Angular with Bootstrap for the front end. The data is stored in a JSON file and seamlessly hosted using json-server.

**Key Features:**

**Angular with Bootstrap:** Leveraging the power of Angular and Bootstrap frameworks, I have created a visually appealing and responsive website interface that ensures optimal user experience across multiple devices.

**JSON Data Storage:** The website's data, including product information, is stored in a JSON file, which allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation of data through JSON APIs. The json-server platform is utilized for smooth data hosting.

**Pagination with ej2-grid:** To enhance browsing efficiency, I have implemented pagination using ej2-grid, a robust and customizable grid control, enabling users to navigate through clothing products effortlessly.

**ngForms Implementation:** By utilizing ngForms, I have incorporated robust form handling capabilities into the website, enabling users to submit and update their information seamlessly. This ensures a smooth checkout process and improves user interaction.

**CRUD Operations:** Comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations have been implemented, empowering users to add products to their cart, update product details, and remove items as desired.

**User Registration and Validation:** A secure user registration system has been integrated into the website, enabling customers to create accounts and access personalized features. Thorough validation procedures are in place to ensure accurate and secure user data entry.

**Login, Registration, and Cart Services:** To provide a seamless user experience, I have developed various services for login, registration, and cart management. These services enable efficient handling of user authentication, user session management, and cart functionalities.
